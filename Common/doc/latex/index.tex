S\+U2 suite is an open-\/source collection of C++ based software tools to perform P\+DE analysis and P\+DE constrained optimization problems. The toolset is designed with computational fluid dynamics and aerodynamic shape optimization in mind, but is extensible to include other families of governing equations such as potential flow, electrodynamics, chemically reacting flows, and many others. S\+U2 is released under an open-\/source license.

The following technical documentation describes the structure and details of the source code for developers.
